# Your Code Review

In this file, please replace all this text with a review of all the code that has recently been added (marked with comments `NEW ADDITION PROPOSED` in the code files).

Assume you'll share this review with another person who recently added that code. Identify any bugs that were introduced, and make any other comments on that code (functional, stylistic, things to think about in the future) that you want to share. This isn't a trick question -- we're genuinely interested in your thoughts and how you'd share them in writing with another engineer.

Being brief is ideal! We're not expecting more than a couple hundred words or so.

This is a markdown file -- you can check out https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ if you want to learn about how to style text in Markdown.
